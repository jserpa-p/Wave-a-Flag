# Wave-a-Flag

In this challenge it is given to you a file warm.

This file is an executable, so you execute it: ./warm

It will say something like: "-bash: ./warm: Permission denied"

If you study the permissions in shell you'll learn that there is a command for changing the permissions, chmod.

You'll have to change the permissions of warm, chmod 777 warm.

Then, if you execute it with the changed permissions it will give you the flag!
